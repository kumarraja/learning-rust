## [What is Rust?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/rust-introduction/2-rust-overview)

Rust is an open-source, systems programming language that you can use to develop efficient, safe software. With Rust, you can manage memory and control other low-level details. But you can also take advantage of high-level concepts like iteration and interfaces. These features set Rust apart from low-level languages like C and C++.

Rust also offers the following advantages that make it a great fit for a wide range of applications:

* Type safe: The compiler assures that no operation will be applied to a variable of a wrong type.
* Memory safe: Rust pointers (known as references) always refer to valid memory.
* Data race free: Rust's borrow checker guarantees thread-safety by ensuring that multiple parts of a program can't mutate the same value at the same time.
* Zero-cost abstractions: Rust allows the use of high-level concepts, like iteration, interfaces, and functional programming, with minimal to no performance costs. The abstractions perform as well, as if you wrote the underlying code by hand.
* Minimal runtime: Rust has a very minimal and optional runtime. The language also has no garbage collector to manage memory efficiently. In this way Rust is most similar to languages like C and C++.
* Targets bare metal: Rust can target embedded and "bare metal" programming, making it suitable to write an operating system kernel or device drivers.
